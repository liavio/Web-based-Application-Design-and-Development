# Project Overview
The purpose of this web application is to provide a pet rescue organization with a place for them to post about pets that are available for adoption. 
The rescue center will use this website to reach people across the country that are looking to adopt a pet. 
People visiting the site can look through a gallery of pets available for adoption. 
Users will then be able to submit an application for any pet they are interested in.
